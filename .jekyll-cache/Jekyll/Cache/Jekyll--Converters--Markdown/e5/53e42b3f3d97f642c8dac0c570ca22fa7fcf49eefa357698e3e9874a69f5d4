I"Á<p>I am a GIS Librarian. Eh, <em>kinda.</em> By degree, certainly (<span class="copy-trigger" data-type="gob" data-id="gD18">University of Iowa</span>), and by title in <span class="copy-trigger" data-type="slug" data-id="cv-positions">previous positions</span>. But the joy of having such a unique job is that I‚Äôve been able to define, redefine, and refine it over the years and now, at <span class="copy-trigger" data-type="gob" data-id="gD19">MIT Lincoln Laboratory (MITLL)</span>, I am a developer, mapmaker, and sys admin who happens to work out of the agency‚Äôs library. You can read aaaaaaa-ha-ha-all about it in my ‚Äú<span class="copy-trigger" data-type="slug" data-id="about-cover-letter-gloss">narrative</span>‚Äù but suffice it to say I get to write web apps, APIs, and other custom solutions; make maps; find data; fix data; synthesize data; organize data; and connect systems so that smarter people can do smart things with those data.</p>

<p>‚Ä¶Which is perfect. I believe in data reusability and distribution, cleanliness, interoperability and in the unique opportunity that librarians and other information professionals have to establish, bolster, and progress those values in education &amp; research or just the web generally.</p>
