<p>Althought most of my work is digital/dynamic, there have been occasions to design static ‚Äúdocuments‚Äù - maps, typically, but see <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/t2dzm8tx83ggugl/ccmiller_tenureBox.pdf?dl=0">here</a> for some thumbs of other static designs (contextualized below). By far, however, the furthest I‚Äôve seen my static design distributed was in the early stages of the Vulcan Carbon Emissions inventory. Maps I made for that team are clear, visual representations of what is in truth a complex dataset and scientific methodology. They evidence the dramatic importance of data representation and visualization in scientific research. Without belaboring the process, I took multiple carbon emission inputs and mapped them to multiple types of geographic/geometric emitters (power plant points, roadway lines, etc.). Then all of those inputs were, in effect, ‚Äúsmeared‚Äù into the cells of a 10-kilometer grid that corresponded geospatially in order to A) facilitate comprehension and reduce the intellectual overhead of users, and B) to facilitate further analysis (atmospheric models, etc.). Various flavors of these styled and rendered maps made it into‚Ä¶</p>
