<p>MIT Lincoln Laboratory is a federally-funded research and development center that "applies advanced technology to problems of national security." As such, they take security very seriously and my work there cannot be shown. I can say that my primary objective when I started in 2012 was to build a system for the storage, search, discovery, and delivery of spatial data. Which I did - with <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a> and <a href="http://postgis.net/">PostGIS</a> on the back end; <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Apache Solr</a>, <a href="http://geoserver.org">GeoServer</a>, <a href="http://geowebcache.org">GeoWebcache</a>, and <a href="https://mapproxy.org">MapProxy</a> in the middle; an API (first in <a href="http://www.slimframework.com">Slim</a>, then <a href="https://nodejs.org">Node</a> that I also consumed with a single-page web app written primarily against <a href="http://backbonejs.com">BackboneJS</a> (but with other fun stuff such as <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a>, <a href="http://leafletjs.com">Leaflet</a>, <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com">Handlebars</a>, all that hip stuff). There were numerous third-party APIs and projects in there as well (e.g. the erstwhile <a href="https://www.freebase.com">Freebase</a>, <a href="https://d3js.org">D3.js</a>, <a href="http://open.mapquestapi.com">MapQuest</a>, <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Main_Page">OpenStreetMap</a>, <a href="http://cloudmade.com">CloudMade</a>. The result was pretty, clean, and a success for my sector. But I cannot show it.</p>

<p>Besides, I scrapped it! Designed, as it was, to enable end-users full control over configuring their data payloads, we didn't really account for the fact that most researchers just want *us* to do it for them, and the app was insufficient for that. So in 2019 I rewrote it, this time (delightfully) in <a href="https://vuejs.org">VueJS</a>. I also dropped MongoDB in favor of a <a href="https://ckan.org">CKAN</a> install and I switched the geocoder to a fully in-house <a href="https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org">Nominatim</a> instance. And it's even prettier, with <a href="http://bulma.io">Bulma</a> in lieu of Bootstrap. And every piece of it is <a href="https://www.docker.com">Dockerized</a>, now, even the reverse proxy Nginx that brokers calls to the stack from clients of all kinds from all over the lab.</p>

<p>There are other projects at MITLL, too, that evidence a growing and diversifying skill set - an API in NodeJS that brokers map routing (against data in PostGIS+pgRouting); a web scraper in NodeJS that harvests web targets based on certain semantic requirements; a MongoDB Map/Reduce workflow that summarizes and reports on many millions of archival items; and numerous ad hoc web apps designed to visualize this or that data problem or to deliver data found on behalf of a lab researcher. However these, too, cannot be copied, distributed, or shown off.</p>

<p>This electronic CV was built during <span class="copy-trigger" data-type="gob" data-id="g|1">my commute</span>. It's a <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> instance that has been draped over <a href="http://backbonejs.com">BackboneJS</a> with <a href="http://leafletjs.com">Leaflet</a> as the map framework. There is a smattering of smaller other libraries in there, as well (<a href="http://lesscss.org">Less</a>, <a href="http://underscorejs.org">Underscore</a>, <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com">Handlebars</a>, etc.) I chose Jekyll so that I could freely and easily write about my work in Markdown and not worry about formatting and display (or even organization, to some extent).</p>

<p>But Jekyll is static (by design) and I wanted something more dynamic for the mapping piece. Fortunately, it's pretty easy to wrap static Jekyll content in the logic and MVC-ness of Backbone (or Ember or Angular, et al, but I use Backbone). Check it, from App.js:</p>


			<code>\{\% capture posts \%\}
						\[
						\{\% for post in site.categories.menud reversed \%\}
						\{
							"title"    : "\{\{ post.title \}\}",
							"url"      : "\{\{ post.url \}\}",
							"order"      : "\{\{ post.order \}\}",
							"slug"      : "\{\{ post.slug \}\}",
							"splash"      : "\{\{ post.splash \}\}",
							"date"     : "\{\{ post.date | date: "\%B \%d, \%Y" \}\}",
							"content"  : "\{\{ post.content | escape \}\}"
						\} \{\% if forloop.last \%\}\{\% else \%\},\{\% endif \%\}
						\{\% endfor \%\}
						\]
						\{\% endcapture \%\}</code>


<p>...And just like that all of that Jekyll content, front matter intact, is available to do with what we please based on this or that model or method in the GUI. (Although *nota bene* - <a href="http://gulpjs.com">Gulp</a> will squeeze this out of the file so it can't really be minimized into your concatenated app.min.js or whatever). "Hey, genius," you'll note - "why not just build your big, fat JavaScript app and pipe static html files into it?" Well, because then I wouldn't have a full and complete Jekyll site sitting around for super fast re-theming (should I decide to do so) AND because I wouldn't have learned what I did about coupling Jekyll with a webmapping framework (Leaflet) in the way I like Leaflet to operate. Who wants their Leaflet map to reset/refetch/redraw every time you hop from one static Jekyll html to another?</p>

<p>P.S. As with several other projects, map data (commute, the locations of my previous positions, etc.) are hosted in <a href="https://cartodb.com">CartoDB</a>, a cloud spatial database with an easy SQL API. In this particular case the data are prefetched and served statically out of the generated Jekyll dir. If for no other reason than it's easier to work on the T that way.</p>

<p>Not long after the 2017 Hubway Data Challenge, and with just a couple of days to enter, I submitted the "2014 Boston Garbage Atlas" to the <a href="https://data.boston.gov/pages/opendatachallenge">2017 Analyze Boston Open Data Challenge</a>. A serious misnomer, this. It was hardly an "atlas" (although it could become one), and instead I merely grabbed a 2014 feed of "Big Belly" data (solar-powered, communicative garbage compressors all around town) and spatio-temporally mapped their statuses during various ~citywide events such as the <a href="http://garbage.milleria.org/#baa/carto_darkmatter/out/1395577860/-71.08205795288087,42.34785606651052,-71.02330684661867,42.37252735093426">Boston Marathon</a> and <a href="http://garbage.milleria.org/#riot/carto_darkmatter/out/1395577860/-71.08205795288087,42.34785606651052,-71.02330684661867,42.37252735093426">Wine Riot</a>, manually making snarky guesses at their probable contents.

	Following the work I did for the 2017 Analyze Boston Challenge it seemed only appropriate, if not ovious, if not a MORAL IMPERATIVE to make a robot that would run 24/7, guessing the contents of various garbage overflows and litterings throughout the city.
</p>
<p>
	...Which is pretty easy in 4 steps:
	<ol>
<li>Manually add to a <a href="https://cloud.mongodb.com">hosted MongoDB</a> collection some spatially-arranged guesses at what might appear in garbage there.</li>
<li>Write a Node API that reaches into <a href="https://mayors24.cityofboston.gov/open311">Boston's Open311 Instance</a> ('s API) for any new calls having to do with garbage, litter, etc. and shops the location of each against the Mongo collection to find the nearest guess (spatially).</li>
<li>For each, tweet the result from <a href="https://twitter.com/311GarbageBot">an account set up specifically for this</a>.</li>
<li>Trigger the bot with an <a href="https://ifttt.com">IFTT</a> applet that fires to the API (hosted in <a href="https://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a>) every time <a href="https://twitter.com/BOS311x">BOS' 311 Twitter</a> posts</li>
	</ol>
</p>
<p>The time it took putting in guesses to keep it fresh felt...excessive, however, so I shut it down. Worked, though!</p>

	An odd thing happened in Spring 2017. I became a web doctor for small business owners whose "web developers" had delivered to them unmanageable, un-updatable, and poorly-performing sites with little-to-zero responsivity and got paid for it. And then walked away, of course.
</p>
<p>
	The first of these is <a href="http://wendymarks.com/">WendyMarks.com</a> - a site whose design (and, tbh, content) I don't condone but whose structure was in bad, bad shape. The site was plagued with performance issues. The ultimate cause was that someobody pretty clearly had found a ~single-page application~ template online somewhere and stuffed all of the client's content into it with no regard for navigation, routing, load optimization, style consistency, or responsiveness. Or SEO, probably obviously. Over the course of a couple of weeks I fixed all of these problems, largely preserving the original style as per client's preference.

<p>Another contract is pending so I won't include it here.</p>

This takes some explaining. <a href="http://www.earwolf.com/show/comedy-bang-bang/">Comedy Bang! Bang!</a> is a long-form improv comedy podcast that A) is often genius, and B) has developed a considerable canon over the years. It's dear to me, so I did what any red-blooded American stan would do and <a href="http://trainertothestarsseekingstars.org/#huh">built an application</a> that delivers A) every mappable location mentioned on the show, and B) every single recurring bit that occurs throughout its entire 8+ year run. I did it because I love the show and it's legitimately joyful labor. But I include it here because it's not <em>not</em> a successful example of reducing what is actually a pretty complex dataset into manageable units and delivering those data as cleanly as possible.
</p>
<p>
	The thing was originally built with the now-common chain of <a href="http://leafletjs.com">Leaflet</a>, <a href="http://backbonejs.com">Backbone</a>, <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr">Solr</a>, and <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a>. It <em>used to be</em> hosted on a <a href="https://www.openshift.com">Red Hat OpenShift</a> instance and the location data <em>used to be</em> in <a href="https://cartodb.com/">CartoDB</a>. 
</p>
<p>However...</p>
<p>In Fall 2017 both OpenShift and Carto changed their plans and I bolted. The bits data are still in a hosted <a href="https://www.mongodb.com">MongoDB</a> instance (<a href="https://mlab.com/">mLab</a>), but the geospatials are now in a different Mongo instance (MongoDB's <a href="https://cloud.mongodb.com">Atlas service</a>); they are indexed in <a href="http://elastic.co">ElasticSearch</a> rather than Solr; <a href="http://bulma.io">Bulma</a> is now providing style rather than Bootstrap; oh, and I completely rewrote the GUI in <a href="https://vuejs.org">VueJS</a>.</p>

This one also needs some context. Evidently not burdened enough by having to, every week, log the recurring jokes in a 90-minute comedy podcast, I decided to learn some knowledge graph techniques by digitizing the entire canon built up by comedian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Daly">Andy Daly</a> over the course of his appearances on various shows over the last decade or so. So, sure, I went back through every appearance of his on Comedy Bang! Bang!, Andy Daly Podcast Pilot Project, Womp it Up, Super Ego, Great American Cabinet of Curiosities, even his one-off on Bajillion Dollar Propertie$. And what I did was simply <em>record every person, place, thing, and event</em> he ever mentioned.
</p>
<p>Then the work began. All of those entities and their relations were imported into an <a href="https://www.arangodb.com">ArangoDB</a> Docker container and sliced up from several angles in order to best illustrate the incredible and meticulous work Daly has done with his characters and their (almost universal) canon over the years.</p>

Another instance where more became less (became more) is my conversion of an old <a href="https://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> blog into a <a href="http://spatialtrack.milleria.org">more svelte and muuuuch faster Jekyll+Leaflet coupling</a>. None of the map plugins for WordPress ever gave enough map, always felt like afterthoughts. When web applications force primary content into little side boxes -- especially map content -- it drives me crazy. Using a custom Leaflet+Jekyll pairing again allows a user to engage the blog copy normally but also allows them to immerse themselves into a full-frame map and access primary content that way, too. More about its guts <a href="http://spatialtrack.milleria.org/this/">at itself</a>. That's a syntactically-legitimate sentence, right?
