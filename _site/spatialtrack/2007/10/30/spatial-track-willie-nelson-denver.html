First of all, don't even <em>bother</em> arguing that <em>Red Headed Stranger</em> isn't one of the top 10 albums ever written. No, no, no, don't– Just...listen, you're trying to shoe-horn "Nevermind" into a list to which it does not belong. It's not that great. Listen to it. Compared to the Warrant oeuvre it's fine (but <em>only</em> "fine"). And <em>only </em> compared to Warrant. Come to think of it, the damage done by "Cherry Pie" alone is probably responsible for a number of revolutions, good or bad. Hip-hop, in a way, right? Hillary Clinton's repeated vilification, prob. And do you think that that Coors Light "Twins!" jingle could have existed outside of a world in which "Cherry Pie" existed, condoned? Answer carefully.</p>
<p>So we agree! Nirvana is basically just a an abstemious Warrant. Swell. Let's get on with a track called "Denver" from that dusty, sparse 1975 masterpiece. A few preamblic notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Willie Nelson digs pot. Can we mark that "established" and move along?</li>
<li>Willie Nelson also seems to dig not giving a fuck. Similar to, say, Ani DiFranco and maybe Prince, if there are >10 tracks that on average reach past 3:00 this dude is going to put it on an album and that album is going out. No questions entertained or answered. No editing required.</li>
<li>Willie Nelson will collaborate with anybody. Name your ASCAP or BMI artist and they are on a Willie track. Toby Keith? Check. Snoop Dogg? Check. A secondary or tertiary deBarge brother? Check.* </li>
<li>If you're of the ilk that will argue you need to be high in order to enjoy this album – or anything – I'll invite you to go ahead and shut up your weed hole. Your tale is a bore.</li>
<li><em>Red Headed Stranger</em> is to be consumed whole, in order. Presenting even one piece of it out of context is a great disservice.</li>
</ol>
<p>So let's take <em>Red Headed Stranger</em> out of context and consider "Denver" here:</p>
<p><em>The bright lights of Denver are shinin' like diamonds<br />
Like ten thousand jewels in the sky<br />
And it's nobody's business where you're goin'<br />
Or where you come from<br />
And you're judged by the look in your eye</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>She saw him, that evenin' in a tavern in town<br />
In a quiet little out of the way place<br />
And they smiled at each other as he walked through the door<br />
And they danced with their smiles on their faces<br />
And they danced with a smile on their face</em></p>
<p>Pretty short, pretty short. But it's got little pieces of most of the album's tropes and could almost be considered a microcosm. Some cowpoke poetry (jewels), some Western morality (judged), a tavern (tavern), and looming tragedy (the smiles don't last). It's all there! Plus it's in 3/4. What more could you want?</p>
<p>And then there's that thing where it has a placename in the title, making it easy to place. I'll put it at the site of Denver's Hotel Teatro, even, nodding Cowboy-style to a nice place to stay <em>and</em> the name of another Nelson album I love.</p>
<p>* Eh, <em>maybe</em>. Not infeasible, though.</p>
