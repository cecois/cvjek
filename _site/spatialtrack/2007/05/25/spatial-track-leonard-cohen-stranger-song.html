    <p>Oh, I guess I’m still doing this. Weird. I assumed the idea would choke on its own breath and never return. But here we are.</p>

<p>This time it’s Leonard Cohen, with arguably his best song <em>ever</em>. No, it’s not “Hallelujah,” you bonesacks, it’s “Stranger Song.” This masterpiece happens to also be attached to what some think is the best Robert Altman film ever, <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067411/" target="_blank">McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller</a></em> (1971). Snow falls lightly throughout most of <em>McCabe</em>, but it’s oppressive en masse. It colors this film as in arguably no other Western (except maybe John Ford’s <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049730/" target="_blank">The Searchers</a></em> in 1956) and it helps the film remind you that there was a frontier of culture and commerce and violence in the NorthWest, too, that looked nothing like that gold and orange expanse that shows up in most films about Western America, even today. <em>McCabe</em> was filmed in West Vancouver, Canada, and the remoteness, sparseness, and starkness of this location is a major feature of Altman’s film. Some film school hump might argue (or have argued back when he gave a single fuxk about such things) that <em>McCabe</em> holds up today in particular as an excellent alternative to the Western mythos - the idea of some macho, gunslinging hero type of which <em>certainly</em> there were fewer than there were squirrely, crafty McCabe types.</p>

<p>Put another way, John Wayne wouldn’t last a minute in <em>McCabe</em>. He’s too…what’s the word, here, full of shit? Too macho? Too brave? The first time he tried to drawl his way through a monologue with some cowering McCabe character they’d pill him in the gut before he could finish.</p>

<ul class="screenbox">
<li class="sceneheader">int. dark bar, much murmuring</li>
<li class="character">Jake Baggett</li>
<li class="dialogue">Listen here, Pilgrim,* if you wanna slither in the sand like a –</li>
<li class="action">a shot is fired into Baggett's throat. Fin.</li>
</ul>

<p>* Sidebar? Did John Wayne ever actually call people "Pilgrim" or is that just part of that stupid Robin Williams bit?</p>

<p>** EDIT: Ok, sounds like maybe he did. But who gives a fuxk. What a waste of two minutes, that was.</p>

<p>Anyway, it just all seems so fitting: Altman’s films (and <em>McCabe</em> in particular) basically play out like gloomy arpeggio folk guitar songs, with lots of busy sound that collectively texture the entire work. Cohen’s song (the original recording, in particular) has this in spades and the cumulative effect makes serious weight. <em>McCabe</em> has plenty of charm from Beatty himself, the dialogue, and the landscape, but in the end what you’re seeing is the frightening, sudden disappearance of a person, almost literally lost in the Western landscape. Likewise, “Stranger Song” is full of characters who are on this or that side of being lost themselves. On purpose, one has to presume.</p>

<h4 id="mapping-it">MAPPING IT</h4>
<p>It would be nice to position that exact spot where the snow blustered over a certain character’s slumped body – beautiful! – but I try not to get into filming locations with these. Let’s back out and just use the entirety of <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/1524231#map=13/49.3597/-123.2074">West Vancouver</a>.</p>

<h4 id="hearing-it">HEARING IT</h4>
<p>So enjoy Cohen’s “The Stranger Song” from Songs of Leonard Cohen, 1967. And then for additional exposition about Altman &amp; Vancouver: <a href="http://www.cinematheque.bc.ca/sept_oct_06/turner.html" target="">this essay</a> by Michael Turner about Altman’s two Vancouver films (the other is <em>That Cold Day in the Park</em> (1969)).</p>
