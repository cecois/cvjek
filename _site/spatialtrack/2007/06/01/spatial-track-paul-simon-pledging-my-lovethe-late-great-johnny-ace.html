    <p>We get it, Rhymin (apostrophe) you dig Johnny Ace. In retrospect, anyway. And I kind of get it: "Pledging My Love" really is pretty, the kind of thing that plays at the end of a long night when it's just you and your future wife remaining.</p>
<p> <em>However...!</em><br />
	There seems to be a problem in Simon's "The Late, Great Johnny Ace." It's not a lack of poignancy, because "Late, Great..." oozes poignancy. It's that Simon saps poignancy from the death of Ace by borrowing poignancy from the deaths of JFK and John Lennon; Lennon's, in particular, by revisiting that night -- that "cold December evening" that makes all of us sad to this day.</p>
<p>
	So poignancy begets poignancy (who uses the word 'poignancy' this much?) when Simon medleys together "Pledging My Love" with his own "Late, Great..." and makes us all get a little rueful about people who were killed for being important. The problem? Ace was a dolt who was killed for being, well, dumber than a bag of jars. To wit...!</p>
<p>
	Ace was a good singer, of course – his original 1955 recording of this Ferdinand Washington and Don Robey 1954 composition became (posthumously) a well-known, big-time hit and is often suggested to have influenced the way Elvis Presley sang songs (good going?). Presley even covered it on the last album before he died in 1977, <em>Moody Blue</em>. But since Simon brought it up, let's map Ace's death, in the current site of Houston's Jesse Jones Hall and the former site of City Auditorium. There, backstage on Christmas Day 1954 (not New Year's Eve, as Simon proclaims in this recording), Johnny Ace did what all thoughtful, tender, amorous balladeers do: he went ahead and put a bullet in his brain. Various accounts (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_ace">Wikipedia</a> and <a href="http://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/catalog/84xmb9fx9780252069697.html">scholarly works</a> alike) offer different reasons for said brains-blowing-out: was it Russian Roullette? Was it from waving the gun around, pointing it at the ladies and bragging about knowing which chamber was golden? A deposition given by – wait, <em>those</em> are the two options?!! He was either playing Russian Roullette OR randomly waving a gun around pulling the trigger?</p>
<p>...Seems like we're splitting hairs at this point, but I digress. James Salem, <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/3052508">writing in <em>American Music</em></a> in 1993 includes the full text of a depostion given by none other than Big Mama Thornton, who describes a kind of one-man Russian Roullette game, wherein Ace terrorized his entire entourage until finally the joke was on him. Swell!</p>
<p>Ok, so after removing points from Salem for shoehorning a Marshall McLuhan citation into his article, where are we? Oh, right: this Paul Simon live recording at Auditorium Theatre in Chicago in 2000, where he contrasts the beautifully dreamy "Pledging My Love" with his own dreary retelling of learning about various unnecessary murders. Unnecessary <em>murders</em>, I say. Because it seems obvious to me that you torpedo the poignancy (grr that word!) of this juxtaposition when you introduce the character of some boozed bully who slumped to the floor from .22 calibers of stupidity.</p>
