  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Here comes a jagged version of “South Coast,” by Ramblin’ Jack Elliot (who here titles it ‘South Coast is a Wild Coast’ - written by Lillian Bos Ross, Sam Eskin, Richard Dehr &amp; Frank Miller). This song has a complicated history, I hear, complicated further by plenty of folk manipulation by its many singers over the years. To the point that “authorship” is maybe a little vague on this one. But Elliot rips into this one pretty well and the result is that a soft-handed lilly-white like me can start to feel the desolation and harshness and terror and beauty of <em>El Sur</em> at a time before there was much settlement at all.</p>

<p>The song was built from a poem written in 1926, 11 years before the opening of the Coast Highway in 1937, and a time when most of the area was inaccessible to vehicular traffic and, in fact, could feasibly have been blank on maps (1). And so goes the story…</p>

<p>A man named Lonjano de Castro rides 40 miles from (~30-60 miles outside of?) his Monterey homestead to Jolon, California every Friday for some grub and mail. Oh, and wives! Can’t forget wives - on one of these trips he wins one in a card game. Like happens from time to time. Ooh, and it was very romantic - here’s their trip back to Monterey:</p>

<pre><code>Her arms had to tighten around me
As we rode down the hills to the south.
But no word did I get from her that day
Nor a kiss from her pretty red mouth.
</code></pre>

<p>Well, cold feet, ya know?</p>

<p>So the wife doesn’t seem super jazzed about being heaped over the ass of a steed like a sack of coffee beans, but she comes around but fast (because what could be easier):</p>

<pre><code>We got to my cabin at twilight
The stars twinkled over the coast.
She soon loved the orchard, the valley
But I knew she loved me the most.
</code></pre>

<p>Some suggest that despite the circumstance the beauty of <em>Big Sur</em> and the South Coast wins over the young bride and all is well. Others prefer to read “I knew she loved me the most” as a yearning delusion by the narrator cowboy. Probably, though, it’s just a fantastic literary trumping and trampling of reality. Besides – and not for nothin’ – we’re reminded repeatedly that a lion still rules the barranca and that the South Coast is a wild coast. So…tough shit, lady. Wild coast and all.</p>

<p>Tougher shit than that, tho – one night the cowboy is injured in a landslide and “like lightning” the wife saddles up and alights for Jolon:</p>

<pre><code>She saddled her pony like lightning.
And rode off for a doctor at Jolon.
A lion screamed in the barranca.
Buck, he bolted and fell on the slide.
My young waif lay dead in the moonlight.
My heart died that night with my bride.
</code></pre>

<p>Whoopsie daisy. Or, I <em>suppose</em>, an unavoidable conclusion to living domestically where living shouldn’t be done at all - out where the untameable foe of nature will always reset life to null. And better still in a way that leaves the cowboy to be his own very icon of wild loneliness. Or some bullshit like that - I like to think that chick was <em>fleeing</em> to Jolon, seizing an obvious opportunity for escape.</p>

<p>Read it how you want, though. There’s a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3VEF1CzUt9cOuJpgsR3fNS">subdued, ballady version of this on an official Elliot album</a>, but his performance at Whelan’s in Dublin is so good Imma make you <a href="http://cl.ly/43340K3R1j2z/download/15%20The%20South%20Coast%20is%20a%20Wild%20Coast.mp3">download it like a caveperson</a>.</p>

<h4 id="mapping-it">MAPPING IT</h4>
<p>“Down the hills” when returning to Monterey from Jolon suggests that de Castro and his new daughterbride might have ridden the Nacimiento Trail (now kinda sorta the Nacimiento-Fergusson Rd. but actually more like Big Sur’s <a href="http://www.hikinginbigsur.com/hikes_millcreek.html">[first of two] Mill Creek Trails</a>), but why start out “to the south”? Nacimiento goes east-west, not very north-south at all and leading south is opposite of Monterey anyway. So this one is a little tricky to map. To the rescue a little comes William Reynolds, writing in <em><a href="http://wcreynolds.com/images/writings/Southcoast.pdf">Ranch and Reata Magazine</a></em>. Tying together Lillian Bos Ross’ <em>The Stranger</em> and her “South Coast” poem, Reynolds basically tells us exactly where this song goes - a ranch somewhere in Big Sur <em>between</em> Monterey and Jolon that had originally inspired Ross to write de Castro’s narrative. Trouble is…where the fuck is that?! Based on the crudely-drawn map Reynolds reproduces in that article, I guessed a spot ~40m north of Jolon near Barlow Flat.</p>
