    <p>Oh, I guess I'm still doing this. Weird. I assumed the idea would choke on its own breath and never return. But here we are! </p>
<p>This time it's Leonard Cohen, with arguably my favorite song of his <em>ever</em>. No, it's not "Hallelujah," you bonesacks, it's "Stranger Song." This masterpiece happens to also be attached to what some of us think is the best Robert Altman film ever, <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067411/" target="_blank">McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller</a></em> (1971). <em>McCabe</em> was filmed in West Vancouver, Canada, and the remoteness, sparseness, and starkness of this location is a major feature of Altman's film. Also a major feature is this location's westernness, as <em>McCabe</em> holds up today as an excellent alternative to (a film nerd might say "deconstruction of") the Western mythos.</p>
<p>Snow falls lightly throughout most of <em>McCabe</em>, but it's oppressive en masse. It colors this film as in no other Western I've seen (except maybe John Ford's <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049730/" target="_blank">The Searchers</a></em> in 1956) and you're reminded that there was a frontier of culture and commerce and violence in the North West, too, that looked nothing like that gold and orange expanse that shows up in most films about that place and time, even today. Put another way, John Wayne wouldn't last a minute in <em>McCabe</em>. He's too...I don't know, American? I imagine it would have gone something...like...this:</p>
<div class="scrippet">
<p class="action">Jake enters, standing nobly beyond the saloon doors, scanning the environs. Nobody notices. A million conversations can be heard but not understood.</p>
<p class="character">jake (wayne)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well I guess the war's over and all the survivors wound up here.</p>
<p class="action">Jake's quip goes unheard over the din.</p>
<p class="character">jake</p>
<p class="dialogue">I said 'I guess the war's over and all the...'</p>
<p class="action">Jake can no longer be heard. Camera has tracked to bar, where The Lawyer sits, alone</p>
</div>
<p>Get it? Because in an Altman film (perhaps <em>McCabe</em> in particular), there's no such thing as a grand, monologic hero shot?</p>
<p>It just all seems so fitting: Altman's films basically play out like arpeggio folk guitar songs, with lots of busy sound that collectively texture the entire work. Cohen's song (the original recording, in particular) has this in spades and the cumulative effect makes serious weight. <em>McCabe</em> has plenty of charm from Beatty himself, the dialogue, and the landscape, but in the end what you're seeing is the frightening, sudden disappearance of a person, almost literally lost in the Western landscape. Likewise, "Stranger Song" is full of characters who are on this or that side of being lost themselves, one has to presume on purpose.</p>
<p>Anyhoo, enjoy Cohen's "The Stranger Song," this (inferior) version from a live performance at Isle of Wight in 1970. And then for additional exposition about Altman &amp; Vancouver: <a href="http://www.cinematheque.bc.ca/sept_oct_06/turner.html" target="">this essay</a> by Michael Turner about Altman's two Vancouver films (the other is That Cold Day in the Park (1969)).</p>
