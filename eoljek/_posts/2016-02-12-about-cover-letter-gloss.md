### I'm Set

My work at MIT Lincoln Laboratory is fun and fulfilling, both personally and professionally. I work with a very talented core personnel who are very dedicated to providing excellent service to the research wing of the Lab.

My work at MITLL is insular and private. Security is aggressive and thorough there and the web apps and APIs I develop are therefore tightly-sequestered and cordoned off. I also commute to Lexington, Mass three times a week. Sometimes more. I take the T! The trip takes about two hours each way. As such, I have grown certain that I could be using my commute (and free time) to contribute to a quality project that is public and open - a good cause.
