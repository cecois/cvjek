### Vulcan
Althought most of my work is digital/dynamic, there have been occasions to design static "documents" - maps, typically, but see [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/t2dzm8tx83ggugl/ccmiller_tenureBox.pdf?dl=0) for some thumbs of other static designs (contextualized below). By far, however, the furthest I've seen my static design distributed was in the early stages of the Vulcan Carbon Emissions inventory were released. Maps I made for that team are clear, visual representations of what is in truth a complex dataset and scientific methodology. They evidence the dramatic importance of data representation and visualization in scientific research. Without belaboring the process, I took multiple carbon emission inputs and mapped them to multiple types of geographic/geometric emitters (power plant points, roadway lines, etc.). Then *all* inputs were, in effect, "smeared" into the cells of a 10-kilometer grid that corresponded geospatially. Various flavors of these maps made it into...

### MITLL
<img height="200px" src="/assets/img/noun_199345_cc.png" class="pull-right" style="padding: 0 2% 2% 2%;"/>
See the <span class="copy-trigger" data-type="slug" data-id="cv-portfolio-digital">Digital Apps/APIs</span> partition of my portfolio for the reasons there isn't any of my MITLL work represented here, but suffice it to say there's definitely an ~offline~ culture alive and well there. For various reasons. Sometimes that means we need to box up some web app/digital resource so that it can run offline, other times it means we, literally, generate a 100 PDFs that collectively provide mapbook-like coverage of a given area. Typically, they were pretty :-/

### Purdue Tenure "Box"
Part of the tenure process at Purdue required a "box" of my work (articles, presentations, syllabi, etc.). Many of these required a certain amount of digital and/or visual design (albeit sometimes out of my control) but I'll [link to this document](https://www.dropbox.com/s/t2dzm8tx83ggugl/ccmiller_tenureBox.pdf?dl=0) because it provides a kind of compendium of my work prior to MITLL and at least I *can* show it.

### Purdue Tenure Doc
Lastly, [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2slebgh83kzuegj/ccmiller_tenureNarrative.pdf?dl=0) is a document left over from a successful bid for tenure at Purdue University. It is a prose case that argues my value to the overall strategic mission of Purdue at that time as well as the specific objectives of Purdue University Libraries. It is included here because it might provide some context for and exposition on how a nominal librarian might come to be a teacher/developer/mappaker/sysadmin.
