I am a GIS Librarian. Eh, *kinda.* By degree, certainly (<span class="copy-trigger" data-type="gob" data-id="gD18">University of Iowa</span>), and by title in <span class="copy-trigger" data-type="slug" data-id="cv-positions">previous positions</span>. But the joy of having such a unique job is that I've been able to define, redefine, and refine it over the years and now, at <span class="copy-trigger" data-type="gob" data-id="gD19">MIT Lincoln Laboratory (MITLL)</span>, I am a developer, mapmaker, and sys admin who *happens* to work out of the agency's library. You can read aaaaaaa-ha-ha-all about it in my "<span class="copy-trigger" data-type="slug" data-id="about-cover-letter-gloss">narrative</span>" but suffice it to say I get to write web apps, APIs, and other custom solutions; make maps; organize data; and connect systems so that smarter people can do smart things with data.

...Which is perfect. I believe in data reusability and distribution, cleanliness, interoperability and in the unique opportunity that librarians and other information professionals have to establish, bolster, and progress those values in education & research or just the web generally.
