### Set

I currently have a very rewarding and compelling full-time position as a Systems Administrator/GIS Librarian (*nix and Mac, primarily) at <span class="copy-trigger" data-type="gob" data-id="gD19">MIT Lincoln Laboratory (MITLL)</span>. My work at MITLL is fun and fulfilling, both personally and professionally. I build web applications, write and consume geospatial (and metadata) APIs, and generally build (or fix) the sinews within and between various web-facing library digital systems[^1] that wrangle a diverse and sprawling technological environment into a cogent set of library services to the Lab community. More on that <span class="copy-trigger" data-type="slug" data-id="cv-portfolio">here</span>

Just prior to that I had a rewarding and successful (tenure) faculty position at <span class="copy-trigger" data-type="gob" data-id="gD16">Purdue University</span>, where I also spent time building library data-delivery systems, but more time building custom digital apps for faculty across campus or partnering with them on their cyberinfrastructure-building programs.[^2] At Purdue I also co-developed, co-taught, and taught a graduate-level course entitled "Geoinformatics" designed to introduce practical, discipline-agnostic GIS techniques and spatial data/metadata concepts with a slight emphasis on contemporary developments in web- and cloud-based spatial data infrastructure (APIs, data repositories, data re-use, etc.)

### But Ambitious

Lincoln Laboratory is also insular and private, however. Security is aggressive and thorough there and my work is therefore tightly-sequestered and cordoned off. I can't even gallery it here, can only <span class="copy-trigger" data-type="slug" data-id="cv-portfolio">loosely describe my projects and accomplishments</span>. I also commute to Lexington, Mass three times a week. Sometimes more. I take the T! The trip takes about two hours each way (<span class="copy-trigger" data-type="gob" data-id="g|1">want to see it?</span>). As such, I am certain that I should be using my commute and other free time to contribute to interesting projects and initiatives out in the external world.
