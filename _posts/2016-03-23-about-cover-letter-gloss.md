My work at MITLL is fun and fulfilling, both personally and professionally. I build web applications, write and consume geospatial (and metadata) APIs, and generally build (or fix) the sinews within and between various usually web-facing library digital systems[^1]. The few specifics I *can* describe can be found <span class="copy-trigger" data-type="slug" data-id="cv-portfolio-digital">here</span> and <span class="copy-trigger" data-type="slug" data-id="cv-portfolio-static">here</span>.

Prior to that I was tenured faculty at <span class="copy-trigger" data-type="gob" data-id="gD16">Purdue University</span>, where I also built library data-delivery systems as well as custom systems for faculty across campus, partnering with them on their cyberinfrastructure-building programs.[^2] At Purdue I also co-developed and taught a graduate-level course entitled "Geoinformatics" designed to introduce practical, discipline-agnostic GIS techniques and spatial data/metadata concepts with a slight emphasis on contemporary developments in web- and cloud-based spatial data infrastructure (APIs, data repositories, data re-use, etc.)

Security at Lincoln Laboratory is aggressive and thorough and my work there is tightly-sequestered and cordoned off. I also commute to Lexington, Mass at least three times a week. The trip takes about <span class="copy-trigger" data-type="gob" data-id="g|1">two hours each way</span>. As such, I am certain that I should be using my commute and other free time to contribute to interesting projects and initiatives out in the external world. Examples of some of those are a also glossed in <span class="copy-trigger" data-type="slug" data-id="cv-portfolio-digital">Portfolio (Digital)</span>.

[^1]: Extant applications there include (an almost laughable amount of) [Drupals](https://www.drupal.org/), [Omeka](https://omeka.org/), [MovableType](https://movabletype.org/), [VuFind](http://vufind.org); back-end technologies include [MySQL](http://mysql.com), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [Zend](http://www.zend.com/), and [Kohana](https://kohanaframework.org/), with tons of shell scripting ([bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) and [zsh](http://www.zsh.org/), typically); a rapidly-growing application of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/); and a smattering of [python](https://www.python.org/) thrown in. I am a master of none of these, a jack of most. Sounds dirty but I'm sure you get it.

[^2]: At Purdue, in addition to the stack of open source tech that sat under my spatial data infrastructure, I did a lot of work in [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/), [ArcGIS](http://arcgis.com), and [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/).
