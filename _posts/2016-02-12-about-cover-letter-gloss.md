### I'm Set

I currently have a very rewarding and compelling full-time position as a Systems Administrator/GIS Librarian (*nix and Mac, primarily) at <span class="copy-trigger" data-type="gob" data-id="gD19">MIT Lincoln Laboratory</span> (literally - I have won <span class="copy-trigger" data-type="slug" data-id="cv-awards-and-recognition">awards</span> there). Prior to that I had a rewarding and successful full-time gig at <span class="copy-trigger" data-type="gob" data-id="gD16">Purdue University</span> (literally - I won <span class="copy-trigger" data-type="slug" data-id="cv-awards-and-recognition">awards there, too, and was granted tenure</span>).

My work at MIT Lincoln Laboratory is fun and fulfilling, both personally and professionally. I build web applications, write and consume APIs, and generally build the sinews within and between various web-facing library digital systems (as well as some of the systems themselves) that wrangle a diverse and sprawling technological environment into a cogent, core set of library servies to the Lab community.

### ...But Ambitious

My work at MITLL is also insular and private, however. Security is aggressive and thorough there and the web apps and APIs I develop are therefore tightly-sequestered and cordoned off. I can't even gallery them here, can only <span class="copy-trigger" data-type="slug" data-id="about-portfolio">loosely describe them</span>, in fact. I also commute to Lexington, Mass three times a week. Sometimes more. I take the T! The trip takes about two hours each way (<span class="copy-trigger" data-type="gob" data-id="g|1">want to see it?</span>). As such, I am certain that I should be using my commute and other free time to contribute to a quality project that is public and open - a good cause. EOL looks like exactly that project.
