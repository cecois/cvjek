### I'm Set

I currently have a very rewarding and compelling full-time position as a Systems Administrator/GIS Librarian (*nix and Mac, primarily) at <span class="copy-trigger" data-type="gob" data-id="gD19">MIT Lincoln Laboratory</span> (literally - I have won <span class="copy-trigger" data-type="slug" data-id="cv-awards-and-recognition">awards</span> there). Prior to that I had a rewarding and successful full-time gig at <span class="copy-trigger" data-type="gob" data-id="gD16">Purdue University</span> (literally - I won <span class="copy-trigger" data-type="slug" data-id="cv-awards-and-recognition">awards there, too, and was granted tenure</span>).

My work at MIT Lincoln Laboratory is fun and fulfilling, both personally and professionally. I build web applications, write and consume APIs, and generally build the sinews within and between various web-facing library digital systems (as well as some of the systems themselves) that wrangle a diverse and sprawling technological environment into a cogent, core set of library servies to the Lab community.

### ...But Ambitious

My work at MITLL is also insular and private, however. Security is aggressive and thorough there and the web apps and APIs I develop are therefore tightly-sequestered and cordoned off. I can't even gallery them here, can only <span class="copy-trigger" data-type="slug" data-id="about-portfolio">loosely describe them</span>, in fact. I also commute to Lexington, Mass three times a week. Sometimes more. I take the T! The trip takes about two hours each way (<span class="copy-trigger" data-type="gob" data-id="g|1">want to see it?</span>). As such, I am certain that I should be using my commute and other free time to contribute to a quality project that is public and open - a good cause. EOL looks like exactly that project.

My work at MIT Lincoln Laboratory is fun and fulfilling, both personally and professionally. I work with a very talented core personnel who are very dedicated to providing excellent service to the research wing of the Lab. My work there is generally to build web applications, APIs, and the sinews within and between various web-facing library systems (as well as some of the systems themselves) that wrangle a diverse and sprawling technological environment into a cogent, core set of library servies to the Lab community.
